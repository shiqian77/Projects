1.Git pull the two files "hwk3p3.m", "run_optimization_methods_rosenbrock.m", and "run_optimization_methods" to local(they must in the same directory).
2.Open matlab
3.In the matlab command window, for problem (V), type:
clear;
x0 = [5,10];
niter = 1000; 
eps = 1e-6;
x = hwk3p3(x0, niter, eps); 

press enter

Notethat: At step 3, if it shows something like "Unrecognized function", please run the files and then click add to path. Then repeat step 3.
It should show you the result in the command window and the plot will appear.

Similarly, if you want to run (iv), the script for (iv) has been commented, the script for (iv) is also in hwk3p3.m.
