1.Git pull the two files "hwk2p3.m" and "plot_steepest_descent_metrics.m" to local(they must in the same directory).
2.Open matlab
3.In the matlab command window, for question4.5, type:
clear;
x0 = [1, 1; -1, 1; -1, -1; 1, -1]; 
c = 3;
x = hwk2p3(x0, c);
press enter

for question 4.6, type:
clear;
x0 = [1, 1; -1, 1; -1, -1; 1, -1];
c = 1000;
x = hwk2p3(x0, c);
press enter

Note that:
If in the command window, shows: Unrecognized function or variable 'hwk2p3'. Open "hwk2p3.m" and "plot_steepest_descent_metrics.m" in matlab,
then run "hwk2p3.m",it will show something like: File/....../hwk2p3.m is not found in the current flder or on the matlab path, then click "Add to path".
Switch to "plot_steepest_descent_metrics.m", run it, if it shows the same thing that file is not found in the current flder or on the matlab path,
then click "Add to path";
if it did not appear this message, now let's go to matlab command window again, or question4.5, type:
clear;
x0 = [1, 1; -1, 1; -1, -1; 1, -1];
c = 3;
x = hwk2p3(x0, c);
press enter

for question 4.6, type:
clear;
x0 = [1, 1; -1, 1; -1, -1; 1, -1];
c = 1000;
x = hwk2p3(x0, c);
press enter

It should show you the result in the command window and the plot will appear.
