1.Git pull two files "hwk5p1.m","run_full_bfgs.m" to local(they must in the same directory).
2.Open all the files in matlab
3.In the matlab command window, type:
x = hwk5p1([30,50,70,90,110,130,150,170,200],1e-6,1000);
press enter

If in the command window, shows something like unrecognized function or variable, just run all the files, it might notify you to add to the path. Then repeat step 3. It will show you the results for 4.a and 4.b.
