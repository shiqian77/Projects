1.Git pull all 12 files to local(they must in the same directory).
2.Open all the files in matlab
3.In the matlab command window, type:
m = 5:5:50;
[x, obj] = final(m, 2 * m, 1, 100);
press enter

If in the command window, shows something like unrecognized function or variable, just run all the files, it might notify you to add to the path. Then repeat step 3. It will show you all the outputs(the mean and std time, their plots, and the SOSC Satisfied percentage) for m = 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50 respectively. (you can also change the value for s and p).
